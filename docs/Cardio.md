## Coronary Artery Disease
### Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease
Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease is characterized by the gradual narrowing of arteries due to atherosclerosis. This condition remains asymptomatic until the stenosis exceeds 75%.
Risk Factors:
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
- Smoking
- Age (> 45 for males, > 55 for females)
- Family history of premature CAD (first-degree relative < 55 for males, < 65 for females)
Management:
- Aspirin
- Statin
- Lifestyle modifications
### Stable Angina (Stable CAD)
Stable Angina, also known as Stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), involves fixed atherosclerotic lesions leading to inadequate perfusion where oxygen demand exceeds supply.
Clinical Presentation:
- Chest pain occurring with exertion, relieved with rest or nitroglycerin
- Typical Angina: Substernal, brought on by exertion/emotion, relieved with rest or nitroglycerin
- Atypical Angina: Meets 2 of the 3 criteria for typical angina
- Non-cardiac: Meets 0-1 of the criteria for typical angina
Diagnosis:
- Clinical symptoms and risk factors
- ECG (generally nonspecific or normal)
- Stress testing
Management:
- Angina: Beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, Nitroglycerin, Ranolazine
- Disease Progression: Aspirin, statin, smoking cessation, hypertension/diabetes control
- Revascularization (PCI or CABG) indicated if:
  - Functional impairment despite medical therapy
  - High-risk lesions (e.g., left-main, 3-vessel, proximal LAD)
Revascularization Options:
- PCI: Single vessel circumflex, right main, some LAD
- CABG: Multivessel, left-main, some LAD
### Stress Tests (Diagnostic Testing for CAD)
Stress tests are essential for diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) by evaluating the heart's response to stress.

Types of Stress Tests:
- Exercise Stress Test:
  - First line, requires the ability to achieve target heart rate and interpret ECG
  - ECG used to look for ST changes
  - Imaging modality (ECHO/MPI) can be added to increase sensitivity

- Pharmacologic Stress Test:
  - Used if unable to exercise
  - Requires imaging (ECHO or MPI)
  - Drug Choices:
    - Adenosine, Dipyridamole, Regadenoson (contraindicated with reactive airway disease)
    - Dobutamine (risk for ventricular arrhythmias)

Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI):
- Uses Tc-99/SPECT or Rb-82/PET
- Visualizes myocardial perfusion before and after stress
- Defects that occur with stress but improve with rest indicate likely ischemia
- Stable defects (poor perfusion throughout the study) indicate likely old scar tissue
## Acute Coronary Syndrome
### Unstable Angina/NSTEMI
General:
- Unstable Angina: Ischemic symptoms without elevation in biomarkers.
- NSTEMI: Ischemic symptoms with elevated cardiac biomarkers.
- Type I NSTEMI: Acute plaque rupture.
- Type II NSTEMI: Imbalance of oxygen supply/demand.
Clinical:
- Chest pain (at rest, new onset with physical limitation, or angina increasing in frequency or duration).
- Other symptoms: Dyspnea, nausea/vomiting (especially in elderly/women).
Diagnosis:
- Clinical features, plus ECG and Biomarkers (TnI or CKMB).
Management:
- Initial (Acute):
  - ASA 325 mg chewed.

  - Morphine (if unacceptable, persistent pain).
  - Beta-Blocker (contraindicated with HF, bradycardia).
  - 2nd ("Dual") Antiplatelet Agent (Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel).
  - Anticoagulation (Heparin or LMWH).
- Reperfusion:
  - Immediate PCI: Indicated if shock, severe CHF, ventricular arrhythmias, structural complications.
  - Reperfuse others within 24-48 hours depending on risk (i.e., TIMI risk score).
### STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction)
General:
- Defined as chest pain + ECG changes + Cardiac Enzyme elevation (TnI/CKMB).
- Most commonly due to acute plaque rupture.
Clinical:
- Persistent substernal chest pain > 20 min.

Treatment:
- Initial management similar to UA/NSTEMI above.
- Reperfusion:
  - Ideally door-to-balloon of 90 min or 120 min if transferred (PCI).
  - Benefits all within 12 hours of symptom onset.
  - 12-24 hours: Reperfuse if ongoing ischemia, HF, hypotension.
  - Fibrinolysis:
    - Used if PCI not available in a timely manner (Tenecteplase, Alteplase).
    - Contraindications similar to those in stroke.

- Post MI autoimmune pericardial inflammation.
- Management: NSAIDs or ASA + Colchicine.
## Heart Failure
### HF: Overview, Chronic Management
Heart Failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's needs. It can be classified into two main types based on ejection fraction: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
HFpEF:
- Ejection Fraction > 50%
- Associated with diastolic dysfunction
- Common causes: obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, aging, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy
HFrEF:
- Ejection Fraction < 40%
- Associated with systolic dysfunction
- Common causes: ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis
Clinical Features:
- Right-sided HF: peripheral edema, jugular venous distension (JVD), hepatomegaly
- Left-sided HF: pulmonary edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
- Physical exam: S3 heart sound, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), rales, JVD
- Chest X-ray: interstitial edema, Kerley B lines, pleural effusion, alveolar edema
- Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels
Diagnosis:
- Clinical evaluation
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess ejection fraction and diastolic function
- Coronary angiogram to evaluate for underlying coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Right heart catheterization to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and right atrial (RA) pressure
Management:
- Reduced EF:
  - Symptomatic interventions: salt and water restriction, diuretics (e.g., furosemide), digoxin
  - Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol, metoprolol), aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone), hydralazine + nitrates
  - Advanced treatments: inotropes (e.g., dobutamine, milrinone), left ventricular assist device (LVAD), heart transplant
  - Device therapy: implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for EF < 35%, biventricular pacemaker (BiV-Pacer) for EF < 35% with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and QRS > 120 ms
- Preserved EF:
  - Treat underlying conditions
  - Diuretics for volume overload
NYHA Functional Classification:
- Class I: No symptoms with ordinary physical activity
- Class II: Symptoms with moderate exertion
- Class III: Symptoms with minimal exertion
- Class IV: Symptoms at rest
### Acute HF Exacerbation
Acute HF exacerbation refers to the sudden worsening of heart failure symptoms, often requiring urgent medical attention.
Risk Factors:
- Dietary indiscretion
- Medication noncompliance
- Infections
- Trauma or surgery
- Ischemia
- Arrhythmias
- NSAIDs
Clinical Features:
- Dyspnea
- Peripheral edema
- Exercise intolerance
- Weight gain
- Rales
- Elevated JVD
Diagnosis:
- Clinical evaluation
Management:
- Respiratory support: supplemental oxygen, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation if required
- Diuretics: furosemide (2.5 times the home oral dose, generally administered intravenously)
- Monitor for hypokalemia, renal failure, hypotension
- Afterload reduction: nitroglycerin, hydralazine in some cases
- Inotropic agents (e.g., dobutamine, milrinone) if refractory to above measures
### High Output Heart Failure
High output heart failure is characterized by an elevated cardiac output, usually secondary to chronically increased volume status or decreased peripheral vascular resistance.
Etiology:
- Severe anemia
- Hyperthyroidism
- Arteriovenous shunting (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus, arteriovenous fistulas)
- Beriberi
- Sepsis
- Pregnancy
- Erythroblastosis fetalis
Clinical Features:
- Symptoms of heart failure (e.g., elevated JVD, pulmonary edema)
Management:
- Diuretics
- Treat underlying condition
### Cor Pulmonale (Right-heart Failure)
Cor pulmonale refers to isolated right heart failure caused by advanced pulmonary hypertension due to mechanisms other than left heart failure.

Clinical Features:
- Exertional dyspnea
- Angina
- Syncope
- Right heart failure signs: JVD, peripheral edema, prominent S2, right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly
- ECG: right bundle branch block (RBBB), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), right axis deviation
- TTE: right ventricular dilatation, possible tricuspid regurgitation

Diagnosis:
- Right heart catheterization

Management:
- Diuretics
- Treat underlying pulmonary hypertension
## Cardiomyopathy
### Dilated
Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by the dilation and impaired contraction of one or both ventricles, resulting in a reduced ejection fraction (
<
40
%
<40%). The etiology can be ischemic, where focal areas of abnormal wall motion are observed, or non-ischemic, which presents as global hypokinesis. Other causes include viral myocarditis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease, peripartum cardiomyopathy, toxic effects from alcohol or chemotherapy (e.g., Doxorubicin), familial or genetic factors, and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. Patients typically present with symptoms of systolic heart failure. Diagnosis is confirmed through transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and management follows the guidelines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
### Restrictive
Restrictive cardiomyopathy involves the infiltration of the myocardium, leading to impaired ventricular diastolic relaxation. Common causes include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, and Fabry disease. In young children, endocardial fibroelastosis and Loeffler's syndrome (endomyocardial fibrosis with prominent eosinophilic infiltrate) are notable causes. Patients present with diastolic heart failure and prominent right heart symptoms. Diagnosis is made via TTE, which shows diastolic dysfunction with a restrictive filling pattern and biatrial enlargement. Management aligns with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) guidelines.
### Hypertrophic
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder of sarcomere proteins, leading to disorganized and hypertrophied myocytes. It is commonly associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the 
ï¿½
Î²-myosin heavy chain or myosin-binding protein C. Patients present with symptoms of heart failure, chest pain, syncope, or sudden cardiac death. A harsh systolic murmur is often heard at the left lower sternal border. Diagnosis is confirmed through TTE, which reveals asymmetric septal hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Management includes beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, cautious use of diuretics, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. Surgical options like myectomy or alcohol ablation are considered for persistent symptoms.
### Takotsubo (Stress CM)
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a non-ischemic temporary hypokinesis of the myocardium that occurs after severe emotional distress, leading to high catecholamine levels. Patients present with chest pain and symptoms of acute heart failure. TTE shows apical ballooning, which is diagnostic, and a reduced ejection fraction. Treatment is supportive, as cardiac function often returns to normal.
### Right Ventricular Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy
Right ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is a genetic non-ischemic cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular arrhythmias. It can present as cardiogenic syncope or sudden cardiac death in young adults. Diagnosis is confirmed through TTE, and management includes standard heart failure treatments and ICD placement for arrhythmia prevention.
## Cardiac/Vascular Malignancy
### Metastases
Metastases are the most common type of cardiac neoplasm, accounting for 75% of cases. Common primary sites include melanoma, lung, breast, soft-tissue, and liquid tumors. These malignancies spread to the heart, leading to various cardiovascular symptoms and complications.
### Atrial Myxoma
Atrial myxoma is a benign mesenchymal growth, often pedunculated and located in the left atrium. It is the most common primary cardiac malignancy. Clinical manifestations include:
- Cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations
- Embolization leading to stroke or arterial occlusion
- Constitutional symptoms like fever and weight loss
- A low-pitched diastolic murmur, also known as a "diastolic plop"

Diagnosis is typically made via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Management involves surgical removal of the tumor.
### Rhabdomyomas
Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors that occur almost entirely in children and are often associated with tuberous sclerosis. These tumors can cause obstruction of blood flow within the heart, leading to various symptoms depending on their size and location.
### Angiosarcoma
Angiosarcoma is a rare malignancy of the blood vessels, typically occurring in the head, neck, and breast areas, particularly in sun-exposed regions. It usually affects elderly individuals and is associated with:
- Radiation therapy
- Chronic postmastectomy lymphedema

Clinical presentation includes rapidly growing, painful masses that can ulcerate and bleed. Diagnosis is confirmed through biopsy and imaging studies. Treatment often involves a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
## Pericardial Disease
### Acute Pericarditis
General:
- Inflammation of the pericardial sac.
Etiology:
- Viral (Coxsackie, echovirus, adenovirus), bacterial (TB), fungal.
- Uremia.
- Acute MI, Dressler.
- Autoimmune (e.g., collagen vascular diseases).
- Surgery/Trauma/Radiation.
Clinical:
- Severe, pleuritic chest pain (improves leaning forward).
- Pericardial friction rub (specific).
- ECG (PR depressions, ST elevation).
- TTE (~50% have pericardial effusion).
Diagnosis:
- Clinical Criteria (â‰¥ 2/4 of the following):
  - Classic positional chest pain.
  - Friction rub.
  - Typical ECG changes.
  - Pericardial effusion.
Management:
- Generally self-limited (1-3 week resolution).
- Idiopathic: NSAIDs (Ibuprofen or Indomethacin) + Colchicine.
- Post MI: ASA + Colchicine.
- Uremic: Dialysis.
- Note: Glucocorticoids reserved for those with contraindication for NSAIDs.
### Constrictive Pericarditis
General:
- Fibrous scarring of pericardium resulting in rigid and thick pericardium.
- Restricts diastolic filling of the heart.
- Increased ventricular interdependence.
Etiology:
- Bacterial (e.g., TB), connective tissue disease, surgery, radiation.
Clinical:
- Presents with dyspnea, prominent right heart failure, congestive hepatopathy.
- Elevated JVP, Kussmaul sign (JVP up with deep breath), pericardial knock.
Diagnosis:
- CXR, cardiac MRI or CT (See pericardial thickening +/- calcification).
Management:
- Pericardiectomy.
### Pericardial Effusion
General:
- Fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardial sac.
Risk:
- Pericarditis (of any cause).
- Malignancy.
- Hypervolemia (as seen with CHF, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome).
Clinical:
- Often asymptomatic, but can develop signs of impaired cardiac function.
- Muffled heart sounds, soft PMI, dullness at left lung base (compressed by pericardial fluid), friction rub.
- CXR (water bottle appearance).
- ECG (low voltage, electrical alternans).
Diagnosis:
- TTE (best at establishing effusion and assess hemodynamic compromise).
- Pericardial fluid analysis (if etiology is unknown).
Management:
- Treat underlying disease.
- Can sample fluid if etiology unclear.
- Avoid diuretics.
- Follow with TTE.
### Cardiac Tamponade
General:
- Impaired diastolic function of heart due to pericardial effusion that is under pressure.
- Results from either a large effusion (> 2L) OR rapid accumulation of smaller effusion.
- Equalization of cardiac pressures and decreased cardiac output (ventricular interdependence).

Clinical:
- Presents with signs of hemodynamic compromise, chest pain, dyspnea.
- Cardiogenic shock without pulmonary edema.
- Pulsus paradoxus, narrowed pulse pressure, distant heart sounds.
- Beck's Triad: (1) Hypotension (2) JVD (3) Muffled heart sounds.
- ECG with decreased voltage, electrical alternans.

Diagnosis:
- TTE (confirms effusion) + elevated pulsus paradoxus.

Management:
- IV fluids.
- Nonhemorrhagic: Urgent pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage.
- Hemorrhagic (traumatic): Surgical drainage and repair.
## Inflammatory Cardiac Disease
### Myocarditis
Myocarditis is characterized by inflammation of the myocardium, which can lead to cardiac dysfunction. The etiology is often idiopathic or viral, with common viruses including Coxsackie B, adenovirus, influenza, CMV, EBV, and parvovirus. Giant cell myocarditis is another notable cause.
Clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from subclinical cases to severe symptoms such as chest pain, heart failure, and shock. Diagnosis involves elevated cardiac biomarkers, ECG changes indicative of myocardial injury, and abnormal cardiac function observed through echocardiography or MRI. A low suspicion for coronary artery disease is also a diagnostic criterion.
Management is primarily supportive, focusing on treating symptoms and underlying causes.
### Rheumatic Fever
Rheumatic Fever is a sequela of group A Streptococcus pharyngitis, occurring approximately 2-4 weeks post-infection due to molecular mimicry involving M protein. It can lead to chronic rheumatic valvular disease.
Diagnostic criteria include either 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor criteria. Major criteria (JONES) include:
- Joints (migratory polyarthritis)
- Pancarditis (endocarditis, pericarditis, myocarditis)
- Nodules (subcutaneous)
- Erythema marginatum
- Sydenham's chorea
Minor criteria include:
- Fever
- Elevated ESR
- Polyarthralgias
- Prolonged PR interval
Evidence of previous Streptococcus infection, such as a positive throat culture or elevated ASO titer, supports the diagnosis.
Management involves eradicating the Streptococcus infection with Penicillin G, managing joint pain with NSAIDs, and providing prophylaxis with Penicillin G (IM q4 weeks), Penicillin V (daily), or Azithromycin (daily) based on the presence and severity of carditis and valve disease.
### Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis
Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE) is characterized by the deposition of sterile thrombi on heart valves. It is associated with advanced malignancy ("Marantic") and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, "Libman-Sacks").
Clinically, NBTE is often asymptomatic until embolization occurs. Diagnosis is typically made via echocardiography.
Management includes anticoagulation with Heparin and surgical intervention if necessary.
### Infectious Endocarditis
Infectious Endocarditis is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, usually affecting the valves. It can be acute or subacute and is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci viridans, Enterococcus, Streptococcus bovis, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, HACEK organisms, fungi (Candida), Brucella, and Coxiella.

Risk factors include prosthetic valves, cardiac devices, valvular disease, congenital heart disease, intravenous drug use (IVDU), and poor dentition.

Clinical manifestations include constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), new murmurs, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, and Roth spots.

Diagnosis is based on the Modified Duke Criteria, requiring either 2 major criteria, 1 major and 3 minor criteria, or 5 minor criteria. Major criteria include positive blood cultures of typical organisms and echocardiographic evidence of endocardial involvement. Minor criteria include risk factors, fever, vascular events, immunologic phenomena, and atypical blood cultures.

Management involves obtaining blood cultures before starting empiric antibiotic therapy, typically with Vancomycin, and transitioning to specific antibiotics based on culture results for a total of 4-6 weeks. Surgical intervention is indicated for severe valve dysfunction or abscess formation.

Complications include heart failure, perivalvular abscess, septic embolization, mycotic aneurysms, and glomerulonephritis.

Prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients undergoing certain procedures, using a single dose of Amoxicillin (or alternatives like Cephalexin, Clindamycin, or Azithromycin).
## Valvular Heart Disease
### Aortic Stenosis
Aortic stenosis is characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to left ventricular outflow obstruction. The primary risk factors include idiopathic "wear & tear" (age > 65), bicuspid valve (around 50 years old), and rheumatic valve disease (rare). Clinically, patients may be asymptomatic or present with a classic triad of heart failure, angina, and syncope in severe cases. The murmur associated with aortic stenosis is a systolic ejection (crescendo-decrescendo) murmur at the second right intercostal space, radiating to the carotids, with a soft S2. Diagnosis is confirmed via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Management involves aortic valve replacement if the stenosis is severe or the patient is highly symptomatic, with options including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
### Aortic Insufficiency
Aortic insufficiency involves inadequate closure of the aortic valve leaflets, leading to regurgitation and increased left ventricular diastolic pressure/volume. This condition can be acute (e.g., endocarditis, aortic dissection) or chronic (e.g., bicuspid valve, rheumatic disease, congenital connective tissue disorders). Clinically, patients present with heart failure symptoms, more severe in acute cases. The murmur is a diastolic decrescendo at the lower left sternal border, accompanied by a wide pulse pressure and signs such as a water hammer pulse and Austin Flint murmur. Diagnosis is confirmed via TTE. Management includes emergent aortic valve replacement/repair for acute cases and medical management of heart failure for chronic cases, with valve replacement for severe or highly symptomatic disease.
### Tricuspid Regurgitation
Tricuspid regurgitation can be functional (due to dilation of the right atrium/ventricle) or result from valve damage (e.g., endocarditis, rheumatic fever, cardiac device injury). Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital cause. Clinically, patients exhibit signs of right-sided heart failure, such as jugular venous distension (JVD), right ventricular heave, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. The murmur is holosystolic, best heard at the left mid-sternal border. Diagnosis is confirmed via TTE. Management involves treating the underlying disorder for functional regurgitation and valve repair or replacement for severe primary valve disease.
### Mitral Regurgitation
Mitral regurgitation can be primary (e.g., mitral valve prolapse, endocarditis, rheumatic valve disease) or secondary (e.g., ischemic papillary muscle/chordae rupture, heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Clinically, it ranges from asymptomatic to left-sided heart failure symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue). The murmur is holosystolic at the apex, radiating to the axilla. Diagnosis is confirmed via TTE, showing regurgitation and left atrial dilation. Management includes emergent valve repair or replacement for acute cases and medical therapy for heart failure in chronic cases, with surgery for severe disease.
### Mitral Valve Prolapse
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) involves myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets, leading to prolapse into the left atrium. It can be primary (idiopathic/familial) or secondary (connective tissue disorders like Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos). Clinically, MVP syndrome includes nonspecific symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea. The murmur is characterized by a midsystolic click and murmur, which varies with maneuvers (e.g., standing/valsalva increases the murmur, squatting decreases it). Diagnosis is confirmed via TTE. Management typically involves reassurance.
### Mitral Stenosis
Mitral stenosis is the obstruction of blood flow from the left atrium to the ventricle, leading to increased pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary circulation. The primary risk factor is rheumatic heart disease. Clinically, patients present with exertional dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, hemoptysis, and atrial fibrillation. The murmur is an opening snap followed by a mid-diastolic rumble, with a loud S1 and P2. Diagnosis is confirmed via TTE, showing mitral valve thickening/calcification, decreased valve mobility, and left atrial enlargement. Management includes surgical intervention (balloon valvuloplasty) and medical treatment for atrial fibrillation and heart failure, with warfarin as the first-line anticoagulant for valvular atrial fibrillation.
## Electrophysiology (EP)
### Bradycardias
Bradycardia is defined as a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). It can be benign, such as in well-conditioned athletes or during sleep, or pathologic, resulting from conditions like SA node disease, increased intracranial pressure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or hypothyroidism. 
Clinical Presentation:
- Generally asymptomatic until the heart rate drops below 45 bpm.
- Symptoms may include fatigue, dizziness, or syncope.
Diagnosis:
- ECG showing sinus origin of P waves with a heart rate of less than 60 bpm.
Management:
- Hemodynamically Stable: Work-up for underlying cause.
- Hemodynamically Unstable: Defined as bradycardia causing CHF, altered mentation, shock, hypotension, or chest pain. Follow ACLS bradycardia algorithm:
  - Identify and treat underlying cause.
  - Start supportive care and cardiac monitoring.
  - If persistent bradyarrhythmia causing shock, altered mentation, ischemic chest pain, or acute CHF, consider transcutaneous pacing, dopamine drip, or epinephrine drip.
Atrioventricular Block:
- First Degree: PR interval > 0.2 sec (AV nodal delay). Management: Reassurance.
- Second Degree Mobitz I (Wenckebach): Progressive PR lengthening into a dropped beat (usually at the level of the AV node). Management: Reassurance (generally benign).
- Second Degree Mobitz II: Consistent PR interval with dropped beats (usually at the level of HIS). Management: Pacemaker (risk to progress to complete block).
- Third Degree (Complete): P/QRS disassociation. Management: Pacemaker.
Sick Sinus Syndrome:
- General: SA nodal dysfunction resulting in a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms, including sinus pauses and tachy-brady syndrome.
- Clinical: Fatigue, presyncope, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea, angina.
- Diagnosis: Telemetry showing sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses/conversion pause, alternating tachy/bradycardia.
- Management: Permanent pacemaker for symptomatic patients.
### Tachycardias
Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate exceeding 100 bpm. It can arise from various factors, including fever, dehydration, blood loss, or conditions stimulating the sympathetic nervous system.
Atrial Fibrillation:
- General: Ectopic atrial rhythm most commonly originating from abnormal foci near pulmonary veins. Atrial HR ~400 bpm, but AV nodal conduction is variable, resulting in a ventricular rate of ~75-125 bpm.
- Risk: Age > 80, HTN, CAD, atrial abnormalities (HF, valvular disease), hyperthyroidism. Can be triggered by alcohol or increased catecholamines (infection, surgery, pain).
- Clinical: Can be asymptomatic or symptomatic (palpitations, presyncope, dyspnea).
- Diagnosis: ECG showing irregularly irregular rhythm without distinct P waves.
- Management:
  - New Onset:
    - Step 1: Rate control (if necessary: Beta-blocker or CCB).
    - Step 2: Cardioversion (if still in AF after trial of rate control). DC electrical cardioversion preferred to pharmacologic. Drug options include flecainide, propafenone, or ibutilide. Note: Patient must be anticoagulated for at least 3 weeks OR have developed AF within the last 48 hours.
    - Step 3: Chronic therapy.
  - If in RVR (rapid ventricular response): IV beta-blocker, CCB, digoxin, or amiodarone. Cardiovert emergently if unstable.
  - Chronic Therapy:
    - Rate Control: Goal HR < 85 (symptomatic) and < 110 (asymptomatic). Drug choice: Beta-Blocker (e.g., Metoprolol) (alt: CCB, digoxin).
    - Rhythm Control: Used for patients < 65 y/o, symptomatic patients needing restoration of sinus rhythm. Flecainide or Propafenone. If CAD: Sotalol. If CHF: Amiodarone.
    - Anticoagulation: Indications based on CHA2DS2-VASc score. Drug choice: DOAC (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban) or Warfarin (INR 2-3).
Atrial Flutter:
- General: Rapid, regular atrial depolarizations with an atrial rate ~300 bpm and ventricular rate of 150 bpm. Caused by a reentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus or atrial scar tissue.
- Clinical: Palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, presyncope. Risk for atrial thrombus.
- Diagnosis: ECG showing atrial rate 300 bpm (saw-tooth shaped waves) with variable levels of conduction across the AV node.
- Management:
  - Medical: Rate control with beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine CCB. Anticoagulate as in atrial fibrillation.
  - Surgical: DC Cardioversion (if ablation is delayed/not planned). Radiofrequency catheter ablation (definitive therapy).
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia:
- General: Arrhythmia with HR > 100 bpm PLUS variable P-wave morphology.
- Risk: COPD (most common), heart failure.
- Clinical: Generally asymptomatic.
- Diagnosis: ECG showing rate > 100 bpm with P waves of at least 3 different morphologies.
- Management: Usually self-limited. Treatment only indicated if the elevated rate is worsening underlying disease (e.g., heart failure), in which case rate control with beta-blockers.
AV Nodal Reentry Tachycardia:
- General: Most common paroxysmal SVT, caused by a reentry circuit in the AV node.
- Risk: Idiopathic, generally with onset in young adulthood.
- Clinical: Acute onset palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea.
- Diagnosis: ECG showing regular narrow complex tachycardia without P waves, +/- retrograde P waves.
- Management:
  - Unstable: DC Cardioversion.
  - Stable: Valsalva maneuvers, carotid massage, IV Adenosine to terminate.
  - Long-term treatment with beta-blockers or surgical ablation.
### Ventricular Tachycardia
Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) is characterized by the rapid firing of more than three premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) originating below the bundle of His, with a heart rate of 120-250 bpm. VT can be classified as non-sustained (< 30 sec, generally asymptomatic) or sustained (> 30 sec, generally symptomatic), and as monomorphic or polymorphic.
Risk Factors:
- Ischemic heart disease
- Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
- Structural abnormalities
Management:
- Non-sustained VT: Search for underlying etiology and treat.
- Sustained VT:
  - No pulse: Follow ACLS protocol.
  - Pulse found: 
    - Stable: IV Amiodarone (alternative: Lidocaine, Procainamide).
    - Unstable: Synchronized cardioversion.
  - Long-term: 
    - ICD Placement.
    - Medications: Beta-blocker or Amiodarone may be indicated.
Torsades de Pointes:
- General: Polymorphic VT with cyclic, sinusoidal changes in the QRS.

- Management: 
  - Stable: IV Magnesium.
  - Unstable: Electric defibrillation.
Ventricular Fibrillation/ACLS:
- General: Arrest of systolic cardiac function from disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles.
- Management: Follow ACLS algorithm:
  - VFib or pulseless VT: Shock, start CPR, rhythm checks every 2 minutes (shock if VT/VF), epinephrine every 3-5 minutes, amiodarone for refractory cases.
  - Asystole/PEA: CPR, rhythm checks, treat reversible causes (5 H's/T's: Hypovolemia, hyper/hypokalemia, hypoxemia, hydrogen ion [acidosis], hypothermia; Thrombosis [pulmonary/coronary], tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins).
### Ventricular Fibrillation/ACLS
Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening condition characterized by disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles, leading to the cessation of effective cardiac output. Immediate intervention is critical to prevent sudden cardiac death.
Management:
- Follow the ACLS algorithm:
  - VFib or Pulseless VT:
    - Deliver a shock.
    - Start CPR immediately after the shock.
    - Perform rhythm checks every 2 minutes and deliver additional shocks if VT/VF persists.
    - Administer epinephrine every 3-5 minutes.
    - Consider amiodarone for refractory cases.
  - Asystole/PEA:
    - Continue CPR.
    - Perform rhythm checks.
    - Treat reversible causes (5 H's/T's):
      - H's: Hypovolemia, hyper/hypokalemia, hypoxemia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypothermia.
      - T's: Thrombosis (pulmonary/coronary), tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins.
ICD Indications:
- Patients who survive VF or sustained VT should be considered for an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) to prevent recurrence.
### Pacemaker Basics
Pacemakers are devices used to regulate heart rhythm by delivering electrical impulses to the heart. They are indicated for various conditions, including symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, and certain types of heart failure.

Types of Pacemakers:
- Single-chamber pacemaker: One pacing lead implanted in the right atrium (RA) or right ventricle (RV).
- Dual-chamber pacemaker: Two pacing leads implanted (one in the RA, one in the RV).
- Biventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]): Single or dual-chamber leads, plus a coronary sinus lead.

Indications:
- ICD:
  - Cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia (unless a reversible cause is identified).
  - EF < 35% in NYHA Class II/III HF.
  - Channelopathies, including long QT and Brugada syndrome.

  - Recurrent unexplained palpitations.
  - Monitor for atrial fibrillation.
  - Screen for ventricular arrhythmia in structural heart disease.
## Hyperlipidemia
### General Overview
Hyperlipidemia is a systemic condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the bloodstream, primarily cholesterol and triglycerides. These lipids are carried by different types of lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and chylomicrons. Elevated levels of LDL are known to be atherogenic, while HDL is anti-atherogenic. Triglycerides, although not directly linked to atherosclerosis, can cause pancreatitis at very high levels.
Key Points:
- Cholesterol: Integral to cell membranes and hormone formation but excessive levels can lead to atherosclerosis.
- Triglycerides: Serve as an energy source but high levels increase cardiovascular disease risk and can cause pancreatitis.
- Lipoproteins: 
  - LDL: Atherogenic, contributes to plaque formation.
  - HDL: Anti-atherogenic, helps remove cholesterol from arteries.
  - VLDL and Chylomicrons: Transport triglycerides.
Types of Hyperlipidemia:
- Type I (Hyperchylomicronemia): Elevated chylomicrons, low heart disease risk.
- Type IIa (Hypercholesterolemia): Elevated LDL, high heart disease risk.
- Type IIb (Combined Hyperlipidemia): Elevated LDL and VLDL, high heart disease risk.
- Type III (Dysbetalipoproteinemia): Elevated IDL, increased risk of atherosclerosis.
- Type IV (Hypertriglyceridemia): Elevated VLDL, increased risk of pancreatitis.
- Type V (Mixed Hyperlipidemia): Elevated chylomicrons and VLDL, increased risk of pancreatitis and atherosclerosis.
Management:
- Lifestyle Modifications: Diet, exercise, weight management.
- Pharmacotherapy:
  - Statins: Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reduce LDL.
  - PCSK9 Inhibitors: Increase LDL receptor availability.
  - Fibrates: Reduce triglycerides.
  - Niacin: Decreases VLDL production.
  - Ezetimibe: Inhibits cholesterol absorption.

Disorder: Phenylketonuria(PKU)
Incidence 1:15
Enzyme Lacking: Phenylalanine hydroxylase
Examples of Acceptable Foods: Fruits, vegetables, breads, cereals, 
Examples of Foods to Avoid: Meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, legumes
### Management
The management of hyperlipidemia involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy aimed at reducing lipid levels to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Lifestyle Modifications:
- Diet: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol.
- Exercise: Regular physical activity to improve lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular health.
- Weight Management: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight to reduce lipid levels and cardiovascular risk.
Pharmacotherapy:
- Statins: First-line treatment for lowering LDL cholesterol. They inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver.
  - Examples: Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin.
  - Side Effects: Myopathy, hepatotoxicity.
- PCSK9 Inhibitors: Monoclonal antibodies that increase the number of LDL receptors on liver cells, enhancing LDL clearance.
  - Examples: Evolocumab, Alirocumab.
  - Side Effects: Injection site reactions.
- Fibrates: Primarily reduce triglycerides by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).
  - Examples: Gemfibrozil, Fenofibrate.
  - Side Effects: Myopathy, especially when combined with statins.
- Niacin: Reduces the production of VLDL and LDL, and increases HDL levels.
  - Side Effects: Flushing, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia.
- Ezetimibe: Inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine.
  - Side Effects: Diarrhea, myopathy.
### Genetic Dyslipidemia
Genetic dyslipidemia refers to inherited disorders that affect lipid metabolism, leading to abnormal lipid levels in the blood. These conditions often require specialized management strategies.

Types of Genetic Dyslipidemia:
- Familial Hypercholesterolemia (Type IIa): Caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene, leading to high levels of LDL cholesterol and increased risk of atherosclerosis.
- Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (Type IIb): Characterized by elevated levels of LDL and VLDL, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III): Caused by mutations in the APOE gene, leading to elevated levels of IDL and increased risk of atherosclerosis.
- Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (Type IV): Characterized by elevated levels of VLDL and triglycerides, increasing the risk of pancreatitis.
- Mixed Hyperlipidemia (Type V): Involves elevated levels of chylomicrons and VLDL, increasing the risk of pancreatitis and atherosclerosis.

Management:
- Lifestyle Modifications: Similar to those for general hyperlipidemia, including diet, exercise, and weight management.
- Pharmacotherapy: Often requires a combination of lipid-lowering agents to achieve target lipid levels.
  - Statins: Reduce LDL cholesterol.
  - PCSK9 Inhibitors: Enhance LDL clearance.
  - Fibrates: Lower triglycerides.
  - Niacin: Reduces VLDL and LDL, increases HDL.
  - Ezetimibe: Inhibits cholesterol absorption.

### General Overview
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition where the force of the blood against the artery walls is high enough to eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.

## Pediatric Arrhythmia
### Wolff Parkinson White
Wolff Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by the presence of an accessory electrical pathway known as the "Bundle of Kent," which can lead to premature ventricular excitation. This condition can result in tachycardia due to atrial fibrillation/flutter or re-entry of normal conduction (Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia or AVRT).
Clinical Presentation:
- Asymptomatic unless arrhythmia develops.
Diagnosis:
- ECG shows a shortened PR interval and the presence of a delta wave.
Treatment:
- Unstable arrhythmia: Cardioversion.
- Antidromic or Orthodromic AVRT: Vagal maneuvers, Adenosine.
- Atrial Fibrillation: Ibutilide or Procainamide.
- Definitive therapy: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway.
Reference Explanations:
- Cardiac arrhythmias represent a significant clinical challenge due to their potential to disrupt the normal rhythmic contractions of the heart, which can range from mild disturbances to severe, life-threatening conditions. These disturbances in the heart's electrical rhythm can result from various factors including electrolyte imbalances, myocardial infarction, or adverse effects from medications. The management of cardiac arrhythmias is vital for maintaining cardiac function and preventing complications such as ventricular fibrillation, a condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death if not promptly managed.
Reference Formulas:
- The heart rate can be determined by measuring the interval between two successive QRS complexes, known as the R-R interval. The formula to calculate the heart rate, typically in beats per minute (bpm), is given by: 
  
Heart Rate (bpm)
=
60
ï¿½
âˆ’
ï¿½
 interval in seconds
Heart Rate (bpm)=Râˆ’R interval in seconds60
  For an average adult heart rate of approximately 72 bpm, the common R-R interval used is about 0.83 seconds. This formula is integral for evaluating the cardiac rhythm and identifying any deviations from the norm, indicative of potential heart conditions.
### Brugada Syndrome
Brugada Syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
Diagnosis:
- ECG typically shows a pseudo-right bundle branch block with ST elevations in leads V1-V3.
Management:
- Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) placement.
Reference Explanations:
- Understanding the Anatomy, Physiology, and Disorders of the Heart: A Focus on Congenital Cardiovascular Problems. The cardiovascular system, comprising the heart and blood vessels, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the body's homeostasis by ensuring the efficient transportation of blood, nutrients, and oxygen to various tissues. A vital aspect of cardiovascular health is the proper formation and function of the heart and its connecting vessels, which are established during fetal development. However, complications can arise, leading to congenital cardiovascular problems that affect individuals from birth.
Reference Formulas:
- The primary formula relevant to the subtopic of Heart Anatomy and Electrophysiology within the context provided is the equation for Cardiac Output. This equation plays a crucial role in understanding how the heart functions as a pump, driving blood throughout the body, which is fundamental to both heart anatomy and its electrophysiology. The formula for Cardiac Output (CO) is expressed as follows:
  
Cardiac output
=
heart rate
Ã—
stroke volume
Cardiac output=heart rateÃ—stroke volume
  - Heart Rate (HR): This is the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm). It indicates how fast the heart is beating.
  - Stroke Volume (SV): This is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle of the heart with each beat. It reflects the efficiency of the heart as a pump.
  - Cardiac Output (CO): This represents the volume of blood the heart pumps within a minute. It is an essential parameter in assessing cardiac function and is thus of paramount interest in both clinical and physiological contexts.
### Congenital Long QT
Congenital Long QT syndrome is a genetic condition that affects the heart's electrical activity, leading to delayed repolarization and an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia, specifically Torsades de Pointes.
Etiology:
- Mutations in sodium or potassium channels.
- Romano-Ward Syndrome: Autosomal dominant long QT syndrome without deafness.
- Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome: Autosomal recessive long QT syndrome with sensorineural deafness.
Management:
- Exercise avoidance.
- Beta-blockers.
- ICD or pacemaker in certain situations.
Reference Explanations:
- Cardiovascular Physiology: Heart Functions and Blood Flow Regulation encompasses understanding the nuances of how the heart works and how it interacts with the circulatory system to regulate blood flow. A crucial aspect of this understanding involves studying cardiac arrhythmias and their electrocardiographic interpretation, as these disturbances can significantly alter heart functions and, consequently, blood flow throughout the body.
Reference Formulas:
- The Q-T interval can be calculated by identifying the beginning of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave. The normal duration is roughly 0.35 seconds. This interval is pivotal because it encompasses the total duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, essential for analyzing the heart's electrical recovery phase.

## Carotid Artery Disease
### General Overview
Carotid artery disease is characterized by atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid artery, typically occurring at the bifurcation where the internal carotid artery begins. This condition is considered "symptomatic" if the patient has experienced stroke symptoms, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or amaurosis fugax, within the previous six months. These events are often due to thrombus formation, which can either cause a low flow state or embolize.
Clinical Features:
- Stroke (anterior circulation TIA/stroke features, such as those affecting the middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), or retinal artery)
- Amaurosis fugax
- Hollenhorst plaques in the retina (rare but specific)
- Carotid bruit
Diagnosis:
- Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
- Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)
- Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)
Management:
- Symptomatic Patients:
  - 100% Stenosis: Medical management
  - 70-99% Stenosis: Carotid endarterectomy (ideally performed between 3-14 days after stroke symptoms) or carotid artery stenting (if high risk for surgery or lesion is not surgically accessible)
  - 50-69% Stenosis: Carotid endarterectomy (if reasonable life expectancy)
  - <50% Stenosis: Medical management
- Asymptomatic Patients:
  - â‰¥70% Stenosis: Carotid endarterectomy (if low surgical risk/long life expectancy) or intensive medical therapy
  - <70% Stenosis: Medical management (statin, antiplatelet, blood pressure control, etc.)
### Management
The management of carotid artery disease involves both medical and surgical interventions, depending on the severity of the stenosis and the patient's symptomatic status.
Medical Management:
- Statins to lower cholesterol levels
- Antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel)
- Blood pressure control
- Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, healthy diet, and regular exercise
Surgical Interventions:
- Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA): This surgical procedure involves the removal of the atherosclerotic plaque from the carotid artery to restore normal blood flow. It is typically recommended for patients with significant stenosis (70-99%) who are at low surgical risk and have a reasonable life expectancy.
- Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS): This less invasive procedure involves the placement of a stent within the carotid artery to keep it open. It is often considered for patients who are at high risk for surgery or have lesions that are not surgically accessible.
### Subclavian Steal
Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when there is significant stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, leading to a reversal of blood flow in the vertebral artery to supply the affected arm.

Clinical Features:
- Exercise-induced arm ischemia (pain, fatigue, or weakness in the affected arm)
- Vertebrobasilar ischemia (dizziness, vertigo, syncope, or visual disturbances)
- Blood pressure difference of more than 15 mmHg between the affected arm and the normal arm
- Pulse differential between the arms

Diagnosis:
- Clinical examination (pulse exam, blood pressure measurement)
- Duplex Ultrasound Scan

Management:
- Bypass surgery or stenting to restore normal blood flow and alleviate symptoms
## Peripheral Artery Disease
### General Overview
